    imperialColonel "SILENCE! Who permitted you to speak, AI?"
    "Ugh, not this again. Aethelred's one of those goddamn Trueborns who've been calling the shots in the Empire ever since Saktoth the Great's reign. 
     Which means that nothing a mere toaster – or a mutant like me – could have any possible value for him."
    "It might be tolerable if he was actually any good at his job, even if only for a baseline. As it is, me and Sophia could easily outmaneuver him in our sleep."

    nvlChar "Hundreds of years ago, the Legate Saktoth led the Imperial Vanguard Legion in battle against the foes of a burning Empire."
    nvlChar "He crushed the pirates threatening the imperial borders, then joined forces with the human purity advocates of the True Born to subdue the rebellious Free Machines. 
     With these martial triumphs under his banner, he was crowned Emperor."
    nvlChar "The Trueborns were given positions of power in reward for their assistance, and soon came to dominte the new order's politics. 
     In time, the genetically augmented citizens and even those of the great noble houses soon found themselves targets of persecution. 
     The AIs, already little trusted by their human masters, were further constrained; only the necessity of their continued function prevented their outright destruction."
    nvlChar "Still, Saktoth I's reign was a peaceful and well-regarded time, and the worst excesses had yet to take root. 
     After his death, however, the imperial hierarchy ossified, and the structure began to crumble under the weight of a succession of weak emperors."
    nvlChar "In time, those who had felt the boot or the yoke of the old Empire began plotting vengeance. 
             Revolts and invasions broke out across the Imperial borders, the fires of war spreading to seemingly even the most quiet corners of the galaxy.

    "They didn't say it in so many words, but it's not hard to see that ultimately we're just delaying them. The Empire has made too many enemies, and they've been allowed to grow too strong."
